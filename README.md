# Beauty Proffesional Store

This platform is a place specially designed for beauty professionals. It functions as a digital marketplace where these professionals can sell their services to customers using a booking system and online payment options. It's important to note that it's not about beauty locations, but about beauty professionals themselves.

The main idea of this platform is to gather all beauty professionals on one website. Customers can find any beauty professional in any city, in a short period of time. They have the opportunity to see all beauty professionals, their information, Instagram, and their work, before they book any appointment.

Beauty professionals can create an account and offer their services through this platform.
